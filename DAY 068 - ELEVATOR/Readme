🚪 Elevator Controller using Verilog HDL
📘 Project Overview

This project implements a 4-floor Elevator Controller using Finite State Machine (FSM) design methodology in Verilog HDL.
It simulates realistic elevator behavior such as responding to floor requests, controlling movement direction, and opening doors upon arrival.

The RTL is parameterized, making it easy to scale for any number of floors.


⚙️ Features
-> FSM-based control with four operational states:
      - IDLE — waiting for input/floor request
      - MOVE_UP — elevator moving upward
      - MOVE_DOWN — elevator moving downward
      - OPEN_DOOR — elevator reached requested floor
-> Direction logic for upward/downward movement
-> Parameterized design for scalability
-> Door control and floor indication signals
-> Testbench included for behavioral simulation


Design Details
***Architecture***
-> FSM Type: Moore Machine
-> Inputs:
      - clk — System clock
      - reset — Active high synchronous reset
      - floor_request — Desired target floor input
-> Outputs:
      - current_floor — Current floor position of elevator
      - door_open — Indicates door status (1 = Open)
      - direction — Elevator movement (Up/Down)

Simulation Details
-> Simulator Used: ModelSim / Vivado / Icarus Verilog
-> Files Included:
      - elevator.v → RTL design
      - elevator_tb.v → Testbench for simulation


Learning Outcomes
- Understanding FSM-based control system design
- Implementing parameterized RTL logic
- Applying sequencing logic to real-world scenarios
- Debugging and validating designs using testbenches
