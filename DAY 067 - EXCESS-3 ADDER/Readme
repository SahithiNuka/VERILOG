🚀 Excess-3 Adder in Verilog
🎯 Overview

This project implements a 4-bit Excess-3 Adder using Verilog HDL.
It performs addition between two 4-bit Excess-3 coded numbers and generates the Excess-3 sum and carry output.
The design uses a Full Adder (FA)-based structure for bitwise addition and correction logic for proper Excess-3 arithmetic.

⚙️ Features
- Adds two 4-bit Excess-3 numbers (a and b)
- Supports an input carry (cin)
- Produces 4-bit sum (x) and carry (cout)
- Fully synthesizable Verilog RTL
- Includes a self-checking testbench for simulation

Inputs

|  Signal  |  Width  |  	Description  |
|  a	     |  4-bit  |   First Excess-3 input  |
|  b	     |  4-bit	 |   Second Excess-3 input  |
|  cin     |	1-bit	 |   Input carry  |
