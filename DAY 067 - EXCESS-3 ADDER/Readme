🚀 Excess-3 Adder in Verilog

🎯 Overview
This project implements a 4-bit Excess-3 Adder using Verilog HDL.
It performs addition between two 4-bit Excess-3 coded numbers and generates the Excess-3 sum and carry output.
The design uses a Full Adder (FA)-based structure for bitwise addition and correction logic for proper Excess-3 arithmetic.

⚙️ Features
- Adds two 4-bit Excess-3 numbers (a and b)
- Supports an input carry (cin)
- Produces 4-bit sum (x) and carry (cout)
- Fully synthesizable Verilog RTL
- Includes a self-checking testbench for simulation

🧠 Design Description
-> The adder uses four full adders (FA) to compute the initial binary sum of the two Excess-3 coded inputs.
-> Additional full adders and logic are used to adjust the result according to Excess-3 rules.
-> The circuit ensures the output remains in valid Excess-3 form after the operation.
-> The internal carry and sum bits are handled carefully using intermediate wires and logic gates to maintain valid BCD/Excess-3 representation.

The testbench:
-> Applies multiple test cases with different Excess-3 inputs.
-> Monitors the output sum and carry in real time.
-> Displays results in a readable format on the simulation console.

Advantages of Excess-3 Code
- Self-complementary → simplifies 9’s complement arithmetic
- Eliminates invalid BCD states
- Suitable for digital display systems
- Reduces correction complexity in arithmetic circuits
