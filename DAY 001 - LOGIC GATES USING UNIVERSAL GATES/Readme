ðŸš€ Excess-3 Adder in Verilog
ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This project implements a 4-bit Excess-3 Adder using Verilog HDL.
It performs addition between two 4-bit Excess-3 coded numbers and generates the Excess-3 sum and carry output.
The design uses a Full Adder (FA)-based structure for bitwise addition and correction logic for proper Excess-3 arithmetic.
