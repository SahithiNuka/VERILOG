# 100 Days of RTL Designing and Verifying Challenge 

Welcome to the 100 Days of RTL Designing and Verifying Challenge! This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing RTL (Register Transfer Level) design systematically over 100 days.

## Challenge Overview

This challenge covers fundamental and advanced topics in digital design including combinational and sequential circuits, memory design, and practical Verilog implementations.

## Structure

- Each day includes a specific topic with a brief explanation, example code, and exercises.
- Topics start from basics like logic gates and go up to complex designs like FIFOs and clock dividers.
- Encourages regular coding practice and project-based learning.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Follow the daily topics chronologically.
2. Try to implement the examples and exercises on your own.
3. Commit your code daily to track your progress.
4. Use issues and discussions to ask questions and share insights.
